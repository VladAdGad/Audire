To Use This System:

	First: 	Drag a note prefab into your world.
	Second: You can set the text field of the "Note" component of the new note game object in your world to anything you like
	Next:	Now Drag The "PickupNote" script onto your player
	Finally: If you look on the "PickupNote" script on your player you will see an option for Skin, just drag "NoteStyle" skin into this option and that's it!

Now all you have to do is approach the cube (Which is a placeholder, you should replace the cube mesh with your own 3d model of a peice of paper) and press 'E' to open the note.
When you want to close the note press 'E' again.

You can modify the style of the note by editing the provided skin, and by changing the code in the OnGUI function of the "PickupNote" script


Best Of Luck, CharlesD.
