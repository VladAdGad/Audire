  _bookText: 'Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely
    as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful
    amazon, and had once raced old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning
    by a length and a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight
    of the young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was sent
    back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears. After Virginia
    came the twins, who were usually called ''The Stars and Stripes,'' as they were
    always getting swished. They were delightful boys, and with the exception of the
    worthy Minister the only true republicans of the family. As Canterville Chase
    is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway station, Mr. Otis had telegraphed
    for a waggonette to meet them, and they started on their drive in high spirits.
    It was a lovely July evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods.
    Now and then they heard a wood pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or saw,
    deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant. Little squirrels
    peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by, and the rabbits scudded away
    through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls, with their white tails in the
    air. '
